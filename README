Fatty Brewing.
-----------------

This is a project intended to be used for simulating beer brewing. It can be considered abandoned.


Intended design
----------------

Message publication and subscription would be used to control the components of the beer brewery. 

For example:

A mash tun receives work order to mash a brew, given a recipe and target temperatures for the different steps, and pass into a secondary. Passes it into holding tank.

Mash tun, when completed, sends a message back to queue, on ferment-queue, that a specific holding tank has the wort. 
This message also includes the original recipe and order number.

Ferment-controller hears this news, makes contact with the holding tank, fills up fermenter as appropriate, adds any other ingredients. Sends a message back that it is working on filling up the order, will report back when complete, together with the recipe and order number.

After the task is complete, the ferment controller sends a message that it is complete, and is drained into a holding tank.
Message goes to fattypackaging queue, includes the holding tank(s), recipe, order number, and other finally measured measurements such as volume blahblah.

Package-controller then receives message from fattypackaging queue. 
Package controller bottles per recipe and order number.

--Controller activites

Mash tun controller, receives order including recipe.
It takes ingredients, based on recipe, and puts them into a mash tun.
It also adds appropriate temperature

--Component tracking

DB stores the status of each of the components
